## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

Ministry of Defence

## Idea
1.Dynamic Role-Based Scenarios: Applicants could go through interactive, role-specific tasks that mimic actual challenges they'd face. For example, a candidate for a managerial position might handle simulated team disputes, while an artist might present creative designs to a virtual panel.

2.Real-Time Feedback: The software could leverage AI to provide applicants with instant feedback on their performance, highlighting strengths and areas of improvement. Similarly, selectors could receive detailed analytics about each candidate.

3.Adaptable Difficulty Levels: The system could adjust the complexity of tasks in real time based on the candidate's progression, providing a fair evaluation of their potential.

4.Gamified Elements: Badges, rewards, or leaderboards could motivate candidates and make the process engaging. Selectors could even set "missions" to test specific skills.

5.AI Insights for Selectors: An advanced feature might be AI-generated insights for selectors, such as predictive hiring metrics, compatibility scores, or skill-growth potential.

6.Customizable Simulations: Organizations could tailor the scenarios to reflect their unique culture or job requirements, creating a highly personalized experience.

7.Ethical Bias Detection: The software could also include algorithms to flag any unconscious biases in the selection process, ensuring fairness and inclusivity.
